# 3-Floor-Elevator-implemented-using-VHDL
The aim of the project is to design an elevator system that has ground, 1st, and 2nd, (3 floors). It is controlled by the BASYS3 board. VHDL code is used to model the control of the system. This system was built to carry at least 1 kg of weight and operate in a similar way to a realistic elevator.
